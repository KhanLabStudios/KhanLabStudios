    "Overview": "# Website Department\n\nWe're this website for the studio, to present our projects and give information about other departments. It is made with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for serving and [Marked](https://marked.js.org) for markdown rendering.",
    "Development": "# Development Process\n\nFor our part of the project, we will need to create 23 webpages for people who are not familiar with web development. Our development process starts with people designing the layout of their page, then we build the page based off of their design. We also made a Discord bot to allow people to change the text on their page after the layout was made, without needing to know how to code."
