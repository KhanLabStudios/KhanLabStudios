    "Overview": "# Historical Research Department\n\nHere at Timeframe, our history department is in charge of maintaining historical accuracy in each of our fellow students' projects. We have four members: Mikey Henry, Liam Murphy, Ishaan Kendale, and Jack Kolecke. The four of us worked closely with fellow students and classmates of our 9th grade class. We reviewed their video pitches and research essays several times over the course of the term, giving each and every member critical feedback that they needed in order to make their presentations as accurate to real historical events as possible. We have worked closely with each other in order to improve our skills and work on projects for the history department as a whole. We demonstrated this in our Instagram project which included a description of our department and an infographic about the iterative process that we use.\n\nOne notable contribution we made was our slideshow made just when the project was picking up detailing the process of finding and reviewing credible sources. We discussed fact checking and peer review and how certain domains and citations make for a more credible and less opinionated source. We gave this presentation in an attempt to preserve historical accuracy and catch any mistake that people may make early in the research process, preventing papers needing to be revised and big changes from being made. \n\nWorking closely with members of the community and effectively communicating feedback on presentations, pitches, and research papers to our peers have helped everyone have greater historical accuracy in their topic and teach them research skills which will carry them through life. \nTo sum up what has been said throughout the course of this statement for the history department, we are an integral part of the Timeframe group, helping to teach members of our class how to maintain historical accuracy in their projects."
