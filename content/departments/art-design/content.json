    "Overview": "# Art and Design Department\n\nWe are the Art and Design Department. This term, we have contributed to the Pixels of the Past project in many ways. Some of which include making a world map of everyone’s project, creating 3D elements out of model magic, and helping create the Pixels of the Past Logo with the Marketing and Communications Department.\n\nWe created the map to have a physical representation of this project. This physical aspect helps for easy understanding of everyone's projects, and where each individual project lies in the world. To create this map, we first attached two pieces of thick cardboard to create a base large enough to hold everybody’s project. Then, we sketched out the shape of continents onto the cardboard for reference. With this reference in mind, we painted the ocean sections blue and the land sections green. The entire map is 52” by 38”, making it large enough for easy comprehension.\n\nThe 3D elements were inspired by the individual projects of each person in Pixels of the Past. The Art and Design Department interviewed everyone to find out what they wanted as their 3D element. We took this information in consideration to sculpt the 3D elements out of model magic, and then paint them. Some objects include a fist (Iranian Rebellion), a battleship (Baltic Fleet), a Falkland penguin (Falkland War), and a rat (Black Death). We placed these objects on the corresponding location of their project with a flag next to them to identify the project’s creator.\n\nFinally, we also helped the Marketing and Communications Department create the Pixels of the Past logo, now called Timeframe. The Marcom team went through multiple iterations of the design, and throughout the way the Art and Design Department gave them feedback. We especially helped with the colors and the shape of the Dolman. The Art and Design Department has helped tie this project together, and bring it to life and into three dimensions."
