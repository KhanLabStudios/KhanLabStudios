    "Creator Statement": "My Pixels of the Past project is on the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire was one of the longest-lasting empires, and most influential empires. Lasting almost 600 years, and spanning three continents, the empire has a vast and rich history. Specifically I wanted to discover the history of art in the empire.\nI started this project by researching rulers of the empire and came across Suleiman the Magnificent. The longest reigning Sultan of the empire, he is known for his support of the arts. Based on this my research essay was about Suleimanâ€™s contribution to the Ottoman Empire. I talked about his artistic contributions, support for notable artists, and construction of grand mosques; which all helped significantly shape the cultural identity and development of the Ottoman Empire.\nI discovered a time period of the Ottoman Empire called the Sultanate of Women. This was a time period in which women gained influence in the empire, and were able to impact imperial decisions, politics, and internal and external affairs. This period started in 1520 when Suleiman had just come into power, and lasted until 1683. Before the Sultanate of Women, women played their traditional roles of housewife, not having any impact on the empire. I wanted my story pitch to somehow relate to this event, but still include the empire's art history.\nAfter researching and brainstorming I came up with my story. It is an event that kick-starts the Sultanate of women. A story about a teenage girl breaking the cycle of women not working, and inspiring other women to do the same. Throughout this project I have learned a lot about the Ottoman empire. From its history, societal norms, art, and people of the empire. Ottoman history is packed with rich culture and fascinating history.",
